# Control Agents
 
A simulation (in Pure Data) of control agents operating in an environment consisting of an amount of 'stuff' that may be on the left or on the right.  A control agent is able to move the 'stuff' from left-to-right or right-to-left (using a PID controller) according to their settings in terms of intention, effort, attention and compliance.  Successful control is manifest as 'happy', whereas loss of control is manifest as 'sad'.  The environment can be subjected to various (manual, noise or ramp) disturbances which the agent may or may not be able to overcome depending on its settings.  Multiple agents (created using copy and past) can operate in the same environment.  Their setting can be configured to facilitate competition or collaboration.  Audio vocalisations can be enabled to reflect the various internal parameters.
